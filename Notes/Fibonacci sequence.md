### Inferences from Addition Rule

The "addition" rule states that : $F_{n+k} = F_k F_{n+1} + F_{k-1} F_n$

Applying this identity to the case where $k = n$, we get:

$$F_{2n} = F_n (F_{n + 1} + F_{n - 1})$$

From this equation, we can prove by induction that for any positive integer $k$, $F_{nk}$ is a multiple of $F_n$.

Base case: when $k = 1$, we have $F_{n1} = F_n$, which is clearly a multiple of $F_n$.

Inductive step: assume that $F_{nk}$ is a multiple of $F_n$ for some positive integer $k$. We need to prove that $F_{n(k + 1)}$ is also a multiple of $F_n$. To do this, we apply the "addition" rule:

$$F_{n(k + 1)} = F_{n + nk} = F_n F_{nk + 1} + F_{n - 1} F_{nk}$$

Since we have assumed that $F_{nk}$ is a multiple of $F_n$, it follows that $F_{nk + 1}$ is also a multiple of $F_n$ (since $F_{nk + 1}$ is the $(nk + 1)$th Fibonacci number). Hence, $F_{n(k + 1)}$ is a multiple of $F_n$, as required.

Thus, by induction, we have proven that for any positive integer $k$, $F_{nk}$ is a multiple of $F_n$.


In the inductive step, we are assuming that $F_{nk}$ is a multiple of $F_n$, which means that there exists some integer $m$ such that $F_{nk} = m \cdot F_n$. Our goal is to show that $F_{n(k + 1)}$ is also a multiple of $F_n$.

To do this, we use the "addition" rule:

$$F_{n(k + 1)} = F_{n + nk} = F_n F_{nk + 1} + F_{n - 1} F_{nk}$$

We already know that $F_{nk}$ is a multiple of $F_n$, so $F_{n - 1} F_{nk}$ is also a multiple of $F_n$.

Therefore, $F_n F_{nk + 1}$ is a multiple of $F_n$, and so is $F_{n - 1} F_{nk}$. Since the sum of two multiples of $F_n$ is also a multiple of $F_n$, it follows that $F_{n(k + 1)} = F_n F_{nk + 1} + F_{n - 1} F_{nk}$ is a multiple of $F_n$.
